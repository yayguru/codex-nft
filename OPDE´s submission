 OPDE here. Big fan of Logos movement and all what is being build behind. Probably i´n not the best candidate, but i would like to try and create something unique. I have been creating art since so young, mostly graffiti and pure vandalism. Now, last few years i paint on canvas 
and last 5 years have been more into web3 stuff so ignored my favourite thing to do-paint. Tryed to create 3 NFT colections, one was AI and other two were pixel art. Can do digital art, but i am kinda slow as i dont have enough experience, but could create some unique 
pieces if i have time. on some of my IRL canvas i´ve spent 3-6 month(longest). Would love somehow to leave a mark, want to be useful and creative. I think this is a good chance for me to apply what i´ve learned a through my path and see what we come with. Have lost most of 
my digital art on an old pc so showing some IRL stuff i´ve done through past years.

I was thinking about doing some conceptual abstract art including cypherpunk and security elements. Was thinking about doing Pieces in canvas and then tokenize them but, if i have to do all 100 pieces it´s gonna take me 2 years lol. If the collection will consist from different
artists artworks, this could be something unique, maybe even paint a wall and tokenize it. In case i have to do all 100 NFT´s i´d go with pure digital art and just try my best to make something unique and fittable.
